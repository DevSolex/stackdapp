# Environment variables

Used with examples and @stacks/connect + @stacks/transactions:

- `STACKING_POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` — deployed contract address
- `STACKS_NETWORK` — mainnet or testnet
- `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` / `WITHDRAW_AMOUNT` — STX amount string (e.g. "1" or "0.5")
- `USER_ADDRESS` — for read-balance example

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set these.
